<h3>Blogging Engine</h3>
  <p>
    Hosted on here is a blogging engine and because I can't
    think of a better (?) name right now I am calling it Precious Blogs.
    Yes... precious. The backend is built in MySQL and PHP, and the frontend
    is built with <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a>
    and <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>. Many thanks to the wonderful
    people that contributed to and made these tools. They're fantastic.
